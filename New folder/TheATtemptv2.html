        Once upon a time there was a small city in which all the citizens were
         obsorbed in the local weather forcast.The plain looking weatherman was
         speaking into the camera with a concerned expression, announcing the
        approaching storm.Though the storm was only a category one hurricane,
        the entire town panicked! Every last small minded, easliy scared citizen
        lost their mind....literally! Enter Terry, Mind Wrangler Extraordinaire! What do you do?
